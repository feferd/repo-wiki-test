## Markdown Cheat Sheet

Thanks for visiting [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org)!

This Markdown cheat sheet provides a quick overview of all the Markdown syntax elements. It can’t cover every edge case, so if you need more information about any of these elements, refer to the reference guides for [basic syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax) and [extended syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax).

## Basic Syntax

These are the elements outlined in John Gruber’s original design document. All Markdown applications support these elements.

### Heading

# H1
## H2
### H3

### Bold

**bold text**

### Italic

*italicized text*

### Blockquote

> blockquote

### Lists

* Here is a bullet point
* Here is another bullet point; it has sub-points:
  * subpoint 1
  * subpoint 2
  * subpoint 3

but then continues with the original bullet point

* and here's one more point just to drive it home
1. First ordered list item
1. Another item
 * Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
  1. Ordered sub-list
1. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

### Ordered List

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

### Unordered List

- First item
- Second item
- Third item

### Code

`code`

### Horizontal Rule
